# HTTP Methods

Not all resources have all operations, see the reference of each resource.

Methods used with collection endpoints:

| Http Method      | Operation                | Success HTTP status |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------|:--------------------|
| GET              | List collection items    | 200 - Ok            |
| POST             | Create a new item        | 200 - Ok            |

# Authentication

## TOKEN

This TOKEN needs to be sent in HTTP header 'X-API-TOKEN'.

Example:
```X-API-TOKEN: hKp94crjv9OF3UGrCpSXUJw1-UYHhRvLKNLt```

You can generate your token on [API console](https://app.zenvia.com/home/api) inside Zenvia platform website.

## JWT

The JWT token is primarily used by front-end applications for user interactions.

For server to server integrations use [TOKEN](/#section/Authentication/TOKEN) authentication type.
