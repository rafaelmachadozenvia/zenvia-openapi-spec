# Overview

This is the reference documentation for the Zenvia *REST-like* API. The API itself is based on resources that are represented by JSON format and are manipulated using the HTTP protocol.

## Features

You can send messages through the [Zenvia-supported channels](#section/Supported-Channels).

You can also subscribe to events and receive them on a webhook of your choosing. The available events for each and every channel are:

* Messages: Receive messages events for outgoing and/or incoming messages.
* Messages status: Receive status updates for outgoing messages.

## Pre-requisites

Before using this API you need the following:

* **Zenvia Account**: create an account on [Zenvia platform's site](https://app.zenvia.com/)
* **Integrations**: configure desired channels to send and/or receive messages on the [integrations page](https://app.zenvia.com/home/credentials)
* **API Token**: create an API token on the [API console](https://app.zenvia.com/home/api)
* **Webhook** (optional): receive messages by subscribing to events using [subscriptions API resources](#tag/Subscriptions)

You can use the [Sandbox](#section/Getting-started-with-Sandbox) to start using and testing this API immediately.

# Getting started with Sandbox

The fastest way to begin utilizing this API is with our [Sandbox (available on the Zenvia platform)](https://app.zenvia.com/home/sandbox).

As you create your new Sandbox, you'll be guided step-by-step in order to start sending and receiving messages using your desired channel.

You are allowed to send test messages to phone numbers you've connected during a 24-hour period. Following that, you must reconnect your number by sending the keyword once again to continue using the Sandbox's features.

# SDKs

Make it simpler to use our API by integrating our SDK into your software.

These helper libraries are available on [Node](https://github.com/zenvia/zenvia-sdk-node) and [Java](https://github.com/zenvia/zenvia-sdk-java) programming languages and located on our [GitHub](https://github.com/zenvia) page.

# HTTP Methods

HTTP methods are used to manipulate resources. Though, as not all resources allow all HTTP operations, observeOK the reference of each resource below.

Methods used with collection endpoints:

| HTTP Method      | Operation                | Success HTTP status |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------|:--------------------|
| GET              | List collection items    | 200 - OK            |
| POST             | Create a new item        | 200 - OK            |

Methods used with item endpoints:

| HTTP Method      | Operation                    | Success HTTP status |
|:-----------------|:-----------------------------|:--------------------|
| GET              | Retrieve one resource item   | 200 - OK            |
| DELETE           | Delete one resource item     | 204 - No content    |
| PATCH            | Update one resource item     | 200 - OK            |

When an operation is executed successfully, the API will respond with a 2xx status code.

# Error Handling

When one error occurs, the API will return a 4xx or 5xx HTTP status code and the payload with an Error Object.

The error object obeys the follwing schema:

<SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/error.base" />

Responses error codes are detailed below.

| Http Status Code | Code                 | Message                          | Retry request |

# Authentication

## Token
To use this API you need to send the API token in every request.

The token needs to be sent in the HTTP header 'X-API-TOKEN'.

Example:
```X-API-TOKEN: hKp94crjv9OF3UGrCpSXUJw1-UYHhRvLKNLt```

Generate your token on the [API console](https://app.zenvia.com/home/api) on Zenvia platform.

## JWT

The JWT token is primarily used by front-end applications for user interactions.

For server-to-server integrations use the [token authentication](/#section/Authentication/TOKEN) approach.
