## WhatsApp limitations

The WhatsApp API has some limitations:

* To start a conversation with someone you need a specific type of message caled [a template message](#section/Template), which requires approval before being used.

* Messages not being as template content type, can only be delivered inside a 24-hour window since the last sent message by the client to the company.

* When sending PNG images with a **transparent background**, you can get an unexpected final result due to the image processing performed by WhatsApp in order to convert the image to JPEG.
